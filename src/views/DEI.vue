        At B.A.N.G.L.A, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) form the
        non-negotiable foundation of our mission to build global cultural
        connection. Our work thrives on the rich tapestry of human experiences,
        where these principles serve as essential pillars that sustain and
        strengthen our global community.

        We do not discriminate based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender
        identity, sexual orientation, age, ability, language, nationality, or
        immigration status. By celebrating the myriad identities, backgrounds,
        and perspectives that everyone brings, we enrich our programs, challenge
        conventional narratives, and cultivate a more empathetic, interconnected
        world.
