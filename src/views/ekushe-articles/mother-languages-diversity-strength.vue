              Right after birth, every human child cries out notifying the world
              about their arrival. Gradually they learn to interact using
              different signs; and most importantly they learn their respective
              mother tongues which becomes their basic mode of communication.
              Since the beginning of earth, the ability to use one's own mother
              tongue and adopted languages for effective communication has been
              a major distinguishable attribute for human beings from other
              organisms on the earth. This has crucially enabled the continuous
              evolution of human civilization as a multilingual and
              multicultural society.

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Held on February 21, International Mother Language Day (IMLD) aims
              to promote the awareness of linguistic cultural diversity and
              multilingualism.

              On 21 February 1952, the people of East Pakistan — currently
              Bangladesh — sacrificed their lives for the sake of their mother
              language. In 1998, a group of Bangladesh-born-Canadians formally
              urged the General Secretary of the United Nations to consider 21
              February as a global occasion, focusing on saving endangered
              languages. With the support of almost all member countries, this
              proposal got approved by the United Nations Educational,
              Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1999, and was formally
              adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2002.

              However, in the current era of extensive global connectivity, it
              has become a dilemma for many to maintain a proper balance between
              the usage of their mother language and the language of the country
              they live in. There is obviously no straightforward solution in
              this regard. That begs the question — can technology play a
              crucial role in such a scenario?

              Let us consider a situation, have you ever found it hard to
              translate something or understand someone using a different
              language? In such a case, your obvious helping hand can be an
              online AI (artificial intelligence) based translator. For example,

              the staff members or volunteers who could not speak English.

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              However, apart from basic translator utilities, there is a highly
              crucial role that technology can play in this regard- saving
              endangered languages.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Officially there are about 7000 languages-dialects being spoken on
              the earth right now. But more than half of the people in this
              world speak in just 10 languages !! (English, Chinese, Hindi,
              Spanish, French,Arabic,Bangla, Russian, Portuguese, Indonesian).
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              One-third of the languages in the world have 1000 speakers or
              fewer. All of these, from Ainu in Japan to Yagan in Chile, run the
              risk of extinction by the year 2100. Highest number of such
              languages face a crisis in North America. In fact over the past
              century alone, around 400 languages have gone extinct.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Local and indigenous communities usually possess a deep
              understanding of flora, fauna, ecological relations, and ecosystem
              dynamics. Such deep environmental knowledge, along with unique
              cultures and heritages of communities embedded in indigenous
              languages, may instantly get lost when a community shifts to
              another language, or the last speaker of a language passes away.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Also, when a crisis like natural disaster or war strikes a region
              where people speak one of the medium-size but low-resource
              languages, then international aid organizations start facing an
              urgent language barrier. This challenge has been severely felt
              during several catastrophes in the recent past. When an earthquake
              hit Haiti in 2010, it created a sudden need for Haitian Creole
              resources. Ebola outbreaks in West Africa in 2014 affected
              speakers of languages like Swahili, Nande, Mbuba, Krio, Mende and
              Temne. Asylum seekers from Central America often speak languages
              like Zapotec, Q’anjob’al, K’iche’ and Mam. Similar challenges were
              faced in Australia last year during a terrible bushfire across a
              vast region including indigenous territories. Ultimately aid
              organizations try to overcome such barriers with the help of local
              interpreters, but effective tech tools could make that easier and
              faster in such crisis time.

                Google Translator currently supports 249 languages,
              </a>
              so there still remains a long list of languages waiting to be
              accommodated on a global scale.

              It is true that incorporating any language in such a framework
              requires availability of sufficient resources. But it is not an
              impossible task as well to make these tech tools more diversified,
              if we really feel the need to do so. For example-Cherokee,the
              native language of the Cherokee people who live around the
              Oklahoma region in the US, was an endangered language for a long
              time. But now a version of Windows 8 is available in Cherokee, and
              a Cherokee app allows speakers to text in the language. This
              played an instrumental role in the survival of the language.

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Mother languages are the vehicles through which the ideas,
              traditions, customs, stories, and feelings of a community keep
              passing through generation after generation. These vehicles, in
              their versatile forms, need to be kept on the right track through
              all possible options including technological tools. And occasions
              like International Mother Language Day present us a solid
              opportunity to respect and celebrate the amazing diversity of
              languages across the world.
