            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Glocal Languages</h2>

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Bangla or Bengali is the sixth most-spoken language in the world
              in terms of native speakers, with an estimated number of about 275
              million speakers (other estimates: 250 million). Most of them
              reside in the South Asian nations of India and Bangladesh, while a
              sizable number moved to Europe, North America, and other parts of
              the globe. The term glocal is used in geography to connote
              integration between the local and global, and connectedness
              produced by travel, business, and communications. Bengali, we
              might argue, is now a glocal language: its local identity
              originates in South Asia but the language has a global imprint
              thanks to Bengali-speakers who settled in different parts of the
              world. Not surprisingly, this global presence too grows local
              roots, as examples from London and New York tell us. The
              neighbourhood of Brick Lane, Tower Hamlets, and East End by the
              Whitechapel Road in London is home to a substantial
              Bengali-speaking community, largely from present-day Bangladesh.
              While the presence of Bengali sailors in London‚Äôs East End
              neighbourhoods dates back to the 18th century CE, a large number
              of Bengali migrants arrived in various phases post-World War 2 ‚Äì
              due to the British government‚Äôs needs for labour to rebuild after
              the war. Brick Lane‚Äôs distinct identity is celebrated in the
              bilingual English-Bengali names of streets and shops.

              Besides English and Spanish, the top two languages in New York,
              the public schools of New York embrace multilingualism, given the
              multiethnic character of the city, and offer services in the
              native languages of immigrants. In this case, Bengali is among
              several other glocal languages including Chinese, Russian,
              Italian, and Korean: local origins but global presence due to
              migration. Since 2013, Bengali has appeared on election ballots in
              Queens, New York. So does its South Asian counterpart Gujarati in

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Suniti Kumar Chatterji, in The Origin and Development of the
              Bengali Language (1926), profiles Bengali as a member of the Indic
              group of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European family of
              languages, whose existence as an independent language or a
              distinct dialect group goes back about a thousand years. The
              Indo-European language family, as Mate Kapoviƒá demonstrates in The
              Indo-European Languages (2017), comprises today more than 400
              languages which evolved from a single parent language: the
              Proto-Indo-European. Languages, Kapoviƒá adds, are ever-changing
              and branch into separate entities through human migrations.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Likewise, a language, as an entity in itself, too changes all the
              time. Old words die out, some perhaps lost forever, and new ones
              become current. Humayun Azad, in Lal Nil Deepaboli (Lights
              Galore), a biography of Bengali literature for adolescents, points
              out that the Charyapada, the first book in Bengali, a collection
              of poems or songs composed between 950 CE and 1200 CE, is quite
              difficult to comprehend because of the language and words
              involved. Some of its contents include cryptic allegories to
              Buddhist mystical and spiritual practices. However, have all
              traces of ancient linguistic usage completely disappeared from
              modern-day Bengali speech? Perhaps not. Consider, for example, the
              sound ‚Äòchu chu‚Äô [‚Äòch‚Äô as in choose] we produce to call stray dogs.
              Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay, another renowned Bengali author, in a
              work of historical fiction Gaudmallar, set in 7th century CE
              Bengal, represents a forest-dweller who named his pet dog ‚Äòchu
              chu‚Äô ‚Äì a synonym for dogs in Austric languages. More intriguingly,
              it hints at how Bengali itself and its predecessors might have
              drawn from different linguistic sources ‚Äì with its roots in
              Sanskrit and evolution from what Kapoviƒá calls Middle Indo-Aryan
              languages (c. 300 BCE-500 CE): Ashokan prakrit (contemporaneous
              with the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, 3rd c. BCE), Middle prakrit, and
              Apabhramsa [‚Äòprakrit‚Äô literally means ‚Äòderived‚Äô in contrast with
              Sanskrit ‚Äòcomplete‚Äô, ‚Äòperfected‚Äô]. In this context, Bengali‚Äôs
              counterparts are Hindi, Assamese, Marathi, and Sinhala ‚Äì all
              evolved into their modern forms between 1000 CE and 2000 CE.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              A fresh flavour of words entered Bengali from the 13th century CE
              onwards through Persian or Farsi, the official language of the
              Delhi Sultanate (13th c. to 16th c. CE), the Bengal Sultanate
              (14th c. to 16th c. CE), and the Mughal Empire (16th c. to 19th c.
              CE). Despite its long stint as a state language, Persian did not
              wipe out South Asian languages. Both Muslims and non-Muslims
              learnt Persian as it provided incentives to secure jobs. A few
              inscriptions from western India, Z.A. Desai notes, are bilingual,
              written in Persian or Arabic and in Sanskrit or local dialect(s).
              This long coexistence with Persian remarkably enriched the Bengali
              vocabulary.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Growing up in West Bengal in the 1990s often meant turning on the
              television for the evening news in Bengali which featured a
              bulletin of the weather or abohawa. Later, I would learn at school
              that it is formed from the Persian words aab for ‚Äòwater‚Äô and hawa
              for ‚Äòair,‚Äô joined by vav for ‚Äòand‚Äô ‚Äì pronounced as aab o hawa.
              More such loan words assumed a sharper resolution during my rather
              inconsequential dabble in learning Persian at university. A few
              examples:

              Bengali and its hunger for nouns
            </h2>

            <p class="mt-8 text-gray-700">
              Peggy Mohan, in
              <span class="italic"
                >Wanderers, Kings, Merchants: The Story of India</span
              >
              through its Languages, makes a strong case for language mixture
              and migration in South Asia, with examples from Sanskrit,
              Malayalam, Persian, and Nagamese. Elite languages like Sanskrit
              and Persian, Mohan argues, entered South languages where they made
              their own space but did not change their host‚Äôs ‚Äì if I might use
              that word ‚Äì grammar and verbs. In this respect, Mohan proffers
              evidence from Sanskrit-Malayalam and Persian-Hindi/Urdu
              relationships. Malayalam, a language from Kerala in southwestern
              India, is part of the Dravidian language family but its top layer
              is replete with Sanskrit words, especially nouns. The entry of
              Sanskrit in Malayalam dates back to 8th century CE when local
              rulers invited Namboodiri brahmins (priests) from western India to
              officiate fire rituals based on the Vedas (scriptures comprising
              poems or hymns in archaic Sanskrit on philosophy, gods, and
              rituals, put into writing from mid-second millennium BCE; created
              by successive groups of Indo-Aryan speakers of the Indo-Iranian
              branch of the Indo-European family who moved to South Asia from
              about c. 3000 BCE). Much as the Namboodiri brahmins of Kerala
              ensured Sanskrit ‚Äì and their pronunciation of it ‚Äì remained
              pristine, they eventually adopted Malayalam as the vernacular, and
              finally added Sanskrit words to written Malayalam. A familiar
              process unfolded with Central Asians arriving in South Asia from
              the 13th century CE. They nurtured Persian as an elite language
              but switched from languages like Uzbek to early Hindi and later
              Urdu as their vernacular; however, Hindi or Urdu grammar was not
              altered along Persian model(s). Similar to Malayalam,
              <span class="italic">ghazals</span>
              (poems) composed in Urdu from the 1700s by individuals of Central
              Asian-origin have a profusion of Persian nouns.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              The processes Malayalam and Persian experienced ‚Äì besides the
              latter‚Äôs role in engendering Urdu ‚Äì allow us to be perceptive
              about a broader context where South Asian languages integrate new
              vocabulary. In Bengali, this influx continued with words from
              European languages whose speakers entered South Asia ‚Äì and the
              Indian Ocean region ‚Äì on an unprecedented scale from 1500 CE
              onwards. Most of these (including the Persian words), if we
              carefully consider, function as nouns in regular speech. The
              Portuguese <span class="italic">chave</span> (meaning key; ‚Äòch‚Äô as
              ‚Äòsh‚Äô in charade) is <span class="italic">chabi</span> in Bengali
              and <span class="italic">chabee</span> in Hindi-Urdu (‚Äòch‚Äô as in
              choose). Ever got a mouthful from your parents for having
              misplaced ‚Äòalmarir chabi‚Äô? There you go!
              <span class="italic">Almarir chabi</span> in Bengali translates to
              ‚Äòlock to/of the almirah.‚Äô The Cambridge English-Portuguese
              dictionary lists the word ‚Äòalmirah‚Äô (a cupboard/wardrobe not fixed
              to a wall) as deriving from Indian English ‚Äì and the Portuguese
              word is <span class="italic">arm√°rio</span>. The fun does not end
              here. <span class="italic">C√¢mara,</span> the Portuguese word for
              chamber ‚Äì its Dutch equivalent is
              <span class="italic">kamer</span> (meaning room) ‚Äì becomes
              <span class="italic">kaamra</span>
              in Bengali; more particularly in colloquial usage, train-er
              <span class="italic">kaamra,</span> somewhat in the sense of a
              room within a train or tram car. On this note, let us now add a
              dash of English words to the mix. For daily, regular speech or
              <span class="italic"> dans la vie quotidienne,</span>
              Bengali-speakers use words like chair, table, office, bus,
              electric, light, fan, building, and many more. Nor must we forget
              the important but somewhat less glamorous nuts and bolts ‚Äì the
              latter, at times, changes to ‚Äòboltu‚Äô in Bengali pronunciation!
              Err‚Ä¶ you might encounter other Boltus too ‚Äì it is a nickname for
              Bengali boys.

            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              How should we characterize a language with such a colossal
              propensity to internalize loan words and churn those out as its
              very own? Gaston Dorren, a Dutch linguist, in
              <span class="italic"
                >Babel: Around the World in Twenty Languages,</span
              >
              calls Bengali a behemoth because of its complexity: two separate
              signs for the same i sound (as in
              <span class="italic">beat</span>) and another two for u (as in
              <span class="italic">book</span>). These respectively mean the
              vowel sounds of <span class="italic">hrashva-i</span> (the short i
              sound) and <span class="italic">deergho-i</span> (the long i
              sound) and <span class="italic">hrashva-u</span> (the short u
              sound) and <span class="italic">deergho-u</span> (the long u
              sound, as in root). The vowels and diacritics taken together,
              Dorren posits, make Bengali a difficult language for school
              children and printer and typewriter manufacturers. The word
              behemoth, understood as something of monstrous size, power, or
              appearance, would not be too off the mark to describe Bengali‚Äôs
              propensity to consume new stuff, digest it, and produce
              fascinating usages of everyday speech. Bengali-speakers are no
              longer simply limited to using the verb ‚Äòkhaowa‚Äô [to eat] for
              ‚Äòjol/ pani khaowa‚Äô [to drink water] ‚Äì literally meaning ‚Äòto eat
              water.‚Äô They moved on to phrases like ‚Äòcase khaowa‚Äô [to get into
              trouble], ‚Äòjhar khaowa‚Äô [to get berated], or even more bizarre
              ‚Äòcrush khaisi‚Äô (‚Äòkhaisi‚Äô as a spoken variant of ‚Äòkheyechhi‚Äô ‚Äì
              roughly first person singular present perfect tense of ‚Äòkhaowa‚Äô or
              to eat ‚Äì is common to forms of speech in Bangladesh) [to develop a
              crush on or romantic feelings for someone]! C‚Äôest amusant mais
              c‚Äôest vrai!
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Where are we headed?</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Languages, therefore, are ever-evolving. Native speakers of
              certain languages (e.g. Uzbek) can take to new vernaculars, while
              native speakers of others (e.g. Bengali) adopt non-native words to
              a point that they comfortably integrate with everyday speech. Let
              us now approach these phenomena from a different perspective: one
              where native speakers of languages find themselves in alien
              environments, are absorbed in a new linguistic set-up, and still
              leave traces of their origins. To substantiate this, I will insert
              two examples related to the Dutch East India Company (the VOC), a
              European mercantile and colonial power, that traded in the Indian
              Ocean between 1600 and 1800 CE in diverse commodities, primarily
              spices and textiles. South Asia and Southeast Asia were two major
              regions of their commercial operations.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Early on in the 1620s the VOC top brass stressed the company‚Äôs
              need for slaves for their colonies in Southeast Asia, as labour
              was scarce. During 1622-1623, Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the VOC
              governor-general in Batavia, modern-day Jakarta, recommended
              procuring large number of slaves from South Asia, particularly the
              Coromandel Coast in southern India, Bengal, and Sri Lanka, to
              establish the Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia. Such enslaved
              individuals who made their way to Southeast Asia are faceless ‚Äì
              yet traces of their identities and afterlives are discernible.
              These slaves were invariably converted to Christianity and
              rechristened. Their new names pointed to their provenance, e.g., a
              Susana van Bengalen (Susana from Bengal) appears in the archives
              of the VOC in 1753 CE. Instruction in main ideas of Christianity
              for these newly-converted Christians could be imparted in
              Portuguese, or Malayalam, Tamil, and Bengali ‚Äì as Manilata
              Choudhuri shows in her essay ‚ÄúThe Mardijkers of Batavia:
              Construction of a colonial identity (1619-1650).‚Äô‚Äô So, native
              languages could find some space, although ever so slight, in an
              environment where they barely exerted any power.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Besides Dutchmen, the VOC employed Swedes, Germans, French, and
              Belgians ‚Äì a reason why it is sometimes referred to as the world‚Äôs
              first multinational corporation. Like South Asians, they too left
              imprints of their native tongues on the correspondence of the VOC.
              For example, in a letter from Coromandel in southern India to
              Southeast Asia in 1661, all the ‚ÄòU‚Äôs are written as umlaut √º. [See
              Photo 6 below, relevant parts marked in red] Umlauts are
              diacritical marks or accents German uses for vowels a, o, and u to
              denote changes in pronunciation of the vowel or transform it into
              a different vowel. German and Dutch are close cousins but such
              usage is rare in seventeenth-century Dutch ‚Äì at least from my
              experience of reading the language for more than a decade. Most
              likely, the scribe of this letter was a German. Our native
              languages can surprisingly leave residues while writing in a
              second or third language.

              books we read, the more pairs of eyes we acquire to observe the
              world. I might add that languages offer a similar experience: They
              provide different ways to reflect on the world. Their vocabularies
              unravel contours of our pasts while the new streams that flow into
              languages offer us a blurry and open-ended vision of what they, in
