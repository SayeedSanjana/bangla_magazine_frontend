              The Bengal delta, the largest in the world, that spans across India and Bangladesh, is a meeting point for the various rivers that drain the area on their way to their final destination, the Bay of Bengal. The main rivers, Brahmaputra, Ganges, along with their distributaries, intertwine across the land and play a major role in Bengal’s bustling industry, culture, and food. These waterways also served as important modes of transport for people going across the western and eastern regions of Bengal during the colonial period when both these regions were under the British Raj.  Travelling from Calcutta to Dhaka by train involved a stop at Goalondo. The Goalando Steamer was one such regular ferry service that facilitated travel between the Goalando Ghat on the Padma river and Narayanganj Ghat on the Meghna river (both in present-day Bangladesh), before passengers could travel onwards to Dhaka. The ferry journey could last for hours and days, depending on the length of the trip and river current conditions with the boatmen providing transport and rest for passengers as they cruised along the scenic route.

              With any journey that spans hours or even days, a food service that satiates the passengers’ appetite is one of the essential elements of the trip, if not the most important. The boatmen of the Goalando steamer (mostly Muslims, since cooking chicken was a taboo for a significant part of the Hindus) were responsible for feeding their passengers as they made their way along the Padma river. Due to the humble backgrounds of the boatmen and limited resources on board the ferry, the food affair had to be simple but fulfilling. And thus the Goalando Steamer Chicken Curry was born.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6 text-gray-700">
              Nowadays, it is quite common to find dishes like Railway Curry and Dak Bungalow curries across speciality restaurant menus of South Asia that hark back to the time of British Raj, when the Indian subcontinent saw the development of the railways and postal services. While these dishes deserve their own spotlights, a less known dish that is reminiscent of that period is the Goalando Steamer Chicken Curry, a dish specific to erstwhile British Bengal spanning across modern-day West Bengal, India and Bangladesh. A humble chicken curry that deserves as much attention as the railway curries, delicately spiced and thoroughly delicious for all to enjoy.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6 text-gray-700">
              At its core, the dish is extremely simple. It is a one-pot wonder consisting of chicken, onion-garlic-ginger paste, chilies, dried tiny shrimps, dried red chilies for the color, and copious amounts of mustard oil that provides the dish with its quintessential richness and flavor. Since the ferry lacked industrial kitchen equipment or burners, the boatmen would cook this dish in one large pot over open flames, on the deck of the ferry. This open flame cooking also provided the dish with an undertone of smokey flavor that further enhanced the dish’s flavor profile. As the boatmen went about their duties of running the ferry without any hiccups, the dish was left to stew for hours with its delicious smell filling the air along the river. 
            </p>
            <p class="mt-6  text-gray-700">
              The rustic charm of this dish was a testament to the boatmen’s resourcefulness and the humble backgrounds of the passengers who availed the ferry service. This dish was a common person’s dish with no connection to any Rajbaris (royal household) or aristocratic houses, thereby cementing this dish’s reputation among the general populace. However, this dish simultaneously serves as a sorrowful reminder of the partition of Bengal as India and Pakistan (along with East Pakistan) became independent nations in 1947. As the ferry service ceased, the dish fell out of popularity and is now considered a lost heritage since the original recipe was never documented.

              The Goalando Steamer Chicken Curry remains as an artifact of the former times when families could travel across the entire Bengal region without worrying about international borders, passports, and visas. A crude reminder of the time when families migrated overnight across vast regions as communal and religious riots broke out in the area and destroyed the fabric of Bengal’s identity. As displaced and migrated families grapple with their present realities of once united but now separated Bengal, cooking a version of this dish allows them to reclaim a part of their lost heritage while preserving the culinary history of the region and to reminisce the former times when the whole of Bengal was one united Bangla-desh.

              <span class="font-bold">Steps:</span>
              <ol class="list-decimal">
                <li class="">Add chicken, onion, garlic, ginger, chilis (green and red), salt and turmeric powder to a bowl. Add half the mustard oil and massage the chicken for 10 mins along with the aromatics. Marinade for 1-2 hrs.</li>
                <li>Add the shrimp paste after the marination. Massage it with the chicken mixture and set aside for 10 mins.</li>
                <li>Heat the rest of the mustard oil in a pot. Add the chicken with its marinade into the pot and let it simmer on low flame covered for 30 mins. The chicken will cook in its released juices over this low flame.</li>
                <li>After 30 mins, check to see if there is a sufficient amount of liquid in the pot. If required, add ½ cup of water. Let it simmer for 10 mins. </li>
                <li>Add ½ cup of hot water after 10 mins and let it cook covered for another 5-10 mins (or so) till the chicken is tender and completely cooked through. At this point, the chicken should have released all its juices and the gravy should have a thick layer of fat floating on top. </li>
                <li>Turn off the heat and serve with hot steamed rice. Napping after consuming this is optional but recommended.</li>

                Credit for the story comes from different researched accounts and historical anecdotes. The dish was first mentioned by Syed Mujtaba Ali (a renowned author) with roots in Bangladesh. No recipe is authentic to the original steamer curry since that recipe has been lost. The general idea behind this recipe is its low flame cooking style with minimal spices and ingredients that were available to the boatmen. Feel free to use whatever ingredients you have at hand while remembering the good old times of taking a ferry down the Padma River on your scenic journey between present-day Bangladesh and India.
